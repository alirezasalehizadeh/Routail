# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests.
Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Process

2. Create a new branch
3. Code, test, commit and push
4. Open a pull request detailing your changes. Make sure to follow the [template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## Guidelines

* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
